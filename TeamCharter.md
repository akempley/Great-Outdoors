## User Stories
- As an outdoor enthusiast planning a trip, I want to view *detailed information* about hiking and travel destinations - including how to get there, difficulty levels, real-time weather, and ferry schedules, so that I can plan my experience easily from one place. 
- As an international visitor, I want to be able to *translate* the site into my *preferred language* so that I can understand travel information clearly and feel included as part of the community. 
- As a friend or member of the site, I want to *securely log in* to access exclusive content so that I can receive insider tips and special information. 
- As a user who has visited a location, I want to *leave comments* and share my own experiences so that I can engage with others and contribute to a growing outdoor community. 
- As an administrator, I want to easily *upload photos* and add new adventures without needing technical support so that the site stays current and reflects my journeys. 
- As an outdoor guide, I want the ability to *list my offerings* so that I can connect with interested users and *potentially generate income* through the platform.
